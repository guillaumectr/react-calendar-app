# Calendar Application Context Documentation

## Overview

The Calendar Application utilizes a context to manage the state related to the calendar, including the current month and the selected date. This context allows for a centralized state management solution that can be accessed by various components throughout the application.

## CalendarContext

### Purpose

The `CalendarContext` provides a way to share calendar-related state and functions across components without having to pass props down manually at every level.

### Provider

The `CalendarProvider` wraps the main application component and provides the necessary state and functions to its children. It manages:

- The current month being displayed
- The currently selected date
- Functions to navigate between months
- Functions to select a date

### Usage

To use the `CalendarContext`, components should be wrapped in the `CalendarProvider`. Inside these components, the context can be accessed using the `useContext` hook.

### Example

```tsx
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { CalendarContext } from './context/CalendarContext';

const SomeComponent = () => {
    const { currentMonth, selectDate } = useContext(CalendarContext);

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>{currentMonth}</h1>
            <button onClick={() => selectDate(new Date())}>Select Today</button>
        </div>
    );
};
```

## Conclusion

The `CalendarContext` is a crucial part of the calendar application, enabling efficient state management and enhancing the overall structure of the application. By utilizing context, components can remain clean and focused on their specific responsibilities.
